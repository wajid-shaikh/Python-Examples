# list comprehension
# with the help of list comprehension we can create of list in one line

# create a list of squares from 1 to 10

# l = []
# for i in range(1,11):
#     l.append(i**2)
# print(l)

# l2 = [i**2 for i in range(1,11)]
# print(l2)

# negative = []
# for i in range(1,11):
#     negative.append(-i)
# print(negative)

# new_negative = [-i for i in range(1,11)]
# print(new_negative)

names = ['wajid', 'joe', 'alfred']
# new_list = ['w', 'j', 'a']
# new_list = []
# for name in names:
#     new_list.append(name[0])
# print(new_list)

# new_list = [name[0] for name in names]
# print(new_list)
