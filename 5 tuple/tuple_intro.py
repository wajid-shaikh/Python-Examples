# # tuple data stucture
# # tuple can store any data type
# # most important tuples are immutable, once tuple is created you can't update
# # data inside tuple

# example = ('one', 'two', 'three')
# # no append, no insert, no pop, no remove
# # tuples are faster than list

# # methods
# # count, index
# # len function
# # slicing


# l = [1,9,2,3,4,5,6,1,2]
